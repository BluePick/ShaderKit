This is a trivial macOS project that demonstrates each of the shaders being applied with some example settings.

Note: to avoid duplicating code, this references ShaderKitExtensions.swift and all its shaders from the parent directory. It also references GameScene.swift in the iOS project, because all the code is cross-platform.
