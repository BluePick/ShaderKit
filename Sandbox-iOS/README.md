This is a trivial iOS project that demonstrates each of the shaders being applied with some example settings. Although it runs well on the simulator, you should try it on a real device to simulate actual performance.

Note: to avoid duplicating code, this references ShaderKitExtensions.swift and all its shaders from the parent directory.
